# Redux

* redux is in charge of managing our application state
* state is a single plain js object
* application state is completely different and separate to component state
* reducers form application state
* reducers all get tied together by 'combineReducers' in the reducers/index.js file
* for each key in our combineReducers object, we assign one reducer
* and that reducer is responsible for creating this piece of state
* our reducers are in charge of changing our application state over time by the use of actions
* so whenever an action is dispatched it flows through all the different reducers in our application
* each reducer has the option to return a different piece of state than the usual, based on the type of action that was received
* action creators are just simple functions that return an action
* an action is just a plain js object
* actions must always have a type defined
* they can optionally have a payload or any other number of properties
* redux that's so simple, yes, but only simple once you actually understand what's going on.

## Review

* Redux constructs the app state,
* react the views to display that state
* use react-redux to connect the 2 libraries
* app state is generated by reducer functions
* we created 'reducer_books'
* always returns an array of books
* the array contains a list of objects
* each object represents one book
* we added this books reducer to our combineReducers call inside index, in the reducers folder
* this reducer is going to add a key to our global app state, called books, where the key is books and the value is whatever gets returned from the books reducer, in this case, our array of books
* our state is always going to be equal to an object with a key of books and a value of an array of books
* next, we created a component bookList,
* but needed to be aware of state, promoted to container
* by first importing the connect function from 'react-redux'
* and then defined mapStateToProps, and we hooked our component together with this and using the connect function
* we chose the component booklist to connect to the redux store because only booklist cares about the list of books
* finally, made sure app rendered booklist

```jsx
<BookList />
```

* redux generated a state object that contained our books,
* and then mapped that state as props to our component,
* because the state was updated through our reducer
* our component re rendered with that list of books
* whenever application state changes the container will re render as well
* a container is a component that gets bonded to the app state, and we connect or meld the 2 together
* whenever the app state changes the container will re render too
