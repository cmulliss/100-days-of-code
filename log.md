# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on ReactJS Survey App. Problem with tutorial using refs, which are deprecated. Managed to partly fix this with by adding placeholder to the constuctor, then adding this to the input:
``` javascript  
 <input type="text" placeholder={this.state.placeholder} />
```
Will do something else for a while, and then go back to this.
**Thoughts:** 
    Annoying when a tutorial is slightly out of date, but guess it is difficult to keep up with all the rapid changes.

### Day 1: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting the hang of this.props and pulling in objects from seed file.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating, but also interesting trying to work around a slightly? out of date tutorial, using deprecated refs. Got part way, but left it for now to work through the nice fat 'Fullstack React' book! Doing the voting app.

### Day 2: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: continued with book. Getting a bit lost with state and arrays, but will spend more time on this until I get it. Learning a bit more all the time. Found I didn't need to diff files in the (integrated) terminal, but could use 'compare this file with' directly in vscode. 
Now know:
- map creates a new array
- Object.assign to avoid mutating objects
- data flows parent to children through props
- event flows from children to parent through props
- never, never, never mutate state
- have to manually bind custom component methods, as not part of standard React component API
- or can use the 'transform-class-properties' plugin. Can then refactor as arrow functions which will ensure 'this' inside the function is bound to the component 

**Thoughts:** Get a bit lost about where all the methods go, as they are created. Seem to have methods and consts eveywhere. Keep going and go back to earlier stages of tutorials and go through the explanations again.

### Day 7: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working from the fullstack react book again. Going through the first exercise to reinforce understanding of props, using external data file and event handling. Changing to a blog tutorial to help with basics.

**Thoughts:** Understanding a bit more all the time, seems slow progress, but will keep going!
