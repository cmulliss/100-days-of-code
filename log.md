# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Reactjs

### Day 0: Thursday January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on ReactJS Survey App. Problem with tutorial using refs, which are deprecated. Managed to partly fix this with by adding placeholder to the constuctor, then adding this to the input:

```javascript
<input type="text" placeholder={this.state.placeholder} />
```

Will do something else for a while, and then go back to this.
**Thoughts:**
Annoying when a tutorial is slightly out of date, but guess it is difficult to keep up with all the rapid changes.

### Day 1: Friday January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting the hang of this.props and pulling in objects from seed file.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating, but also interesting trying to work around a slightly? out of date tutorial, using deprecated refs. Got part way, but left it for now to work through the nice fat 'Fullstack React' book! Doing the voting app.

---

### Day 2: Saturday January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: continued with book. Getting a bit lost with state and arrays, but will spend more time on this until I get it. Learning a bit more all the time. Found I didn't need to diff files in the (integrated) terminal, but could use 'compare this file with' directly in vscode.
Now know:

* map creates a new array
* Object.assign to avoid mutating objects
* data flows parent to children through props
* event flows from children to parent through props
* never, never, never mutate state
* have to manually bind custom component methods, as not part of standard React component API
* or can use the 'transform-class-properties' plugin. Can then refactor as arrow functions which will ensure 'this' inside the function is bound to the component

**Thoughts:** Get a bit lost about where all the methods go, as they are created. Seem to have methods and consts eveywhere. Keep going and go back to earlier stages of tutorials and go through the explanations again.

---

### Day 7: Thursday February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working from the fullstack react book again. Going through the first exercise to reinforce understanding of props, using external data file and event handling. Changing to a blog tutorial to help with basics.

---

### Day 10: Sunday February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going back to basics. Using a new tutorial that seems really well structured with clear explanations. Following helpful suggestion from OH, maybe need a different tutorial? Understanding 'this' better, and practising es6 syntax.

---

### Day 12: Tuesday February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished basics section, a lot of ES6 and new things like filter.

---

### Day 13: Wednesday February 7, 2018

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 14: Thursday 8 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the tutorial from scratch again to help consolidate learning so far.

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 16: Saturday 10 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Put in over 4 hours today, made up for yesterday. Finished repeat of first section of tutorial. Progessed to starting React Router.

**Thoughts:** Still a bit confused about 'filter', but will go over it again later, and try my own version of the app.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 17: Sunday 11 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with ReactRouter including linking, matching, navlinks, switching and a 404 page.

**Thoughts:** Fun, but a lot of new things to remember. I will go through this all again.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 18: Monday 12 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started routing project. Beginning to get the hang of routing.

**Thoughts:** This is fun!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 19: Tuesday 13 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing Routing project.

**Thoughts:** Driven mad by our slowwwww.... broadband, lucky if we get 0.3Mbps, due to get fibre in the next month or so, can hardly wait. Does make working very difficult. Is a case of npm whatever command, go make another coffee while you wait, and repeat.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 20: Wednesday 14 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting routing project from scratch again, to make sure I am understanding it.

**Thoughts:** Realising I need to update my CSS knowledge as tutorial is doing cool css stuff I hadn't come across.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 21: Thursday 15 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with yesterdays work, progressing with project. Sense of it coming together. Hope to complete it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Getting quite obsessive. As soon as I arrive home spending as much time as possible on this, just stopping to do essential household stuff.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 22: Friday 16 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Backtracking over earlier stuff to get a better grasp of basics in reactjs.

**Thoughts:** Getting a bit lost as tutorial progresses. Seems to be a tendency for the tutorials to start off well, going step by step, then suddenly to accelerate and drop loads of new concepts in without much explanation.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 23: Saturday 17 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched to a new tutorial and this one explains every step clearly (so far). Really good stuff on using es6 instead of bind, and using state without a constructor if not explicitly required.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying this today. Hope tutorial continues to be as helpful.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 24: Sunday 18 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting a better grasp of state and props. Also, interested to find conditional css included.

**Thoughts:** Still getting a bit confused by multiple levels on props, but will go over this again.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 25: Monday 19 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through events, state and props again. Getting a better grasp of these.

**Thoughts:** I will continue with the tutorial and see if this basic stuff starts to consolidate.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 26: Tuesday 20 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Covered different ways of implementing css in React. Objects, glamor and modules. Starting 'filter', can use a function in a child component, from parent via props.

**Thoughts:** Will leave css modules for now as don't want to mess with all the hidden configuration files at this stage. Rather like glamor though.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 27: Wednesday 21 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started routing and linking.

**Thoughts:** Need to go back over filtering and routing tomorrow. Interesting although not clear over reason for using search within link.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 28: Thursday 22 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revised filtering and Routing.

**Thoughts:** Will need to revisit filtering again and continue with Routing.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 29: Friday 23 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More on routing and then restarted youtube search app tutorial. Practising factoring from vanilla js to ES6.

**Thoughts:** More of the basics beginning to make sense. Getting better at ES6 too. Need to go over more of the basics though.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 30: Saturday 24 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redoing the youtube search tutorial, not as easy as expected. Can definitely do more of it than last time, but still getting a bit lost with some of it.

**Thoughts:** Some days really happy with progress, other days quite frustrated. Need to keep a positive attitude and not get discouraged on the difficult days!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 31: Sunday 25 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redoing some state and props and ES6.

**Thoughts:** Slow progress, but getting there. Will go over 'map' tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 32: Monday 26 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Map, filter and generally getting a better grounding in state, props, fat arrows and passing functions via props so can limit use of class component and state.

**Thoughts:** Think I am rather impatient, want to understand it all instantly! In fact need to just keep practising.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 33: Tuesday 27 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working from the Fullstack React book again today, will continue tomorrow.

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 34: Wednesday 28 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with second tutorial from book.

**Thoughts:** Will do a bit more of this and then maybe back to video tutorials

**Today's Progress**: Good progress with the youtube search tutorial. Getting the hang of callbacks etc.

**Thoughts:** Will complete this tomorrow, hopefully.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 36: Friday 2 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed youtube search tutorial. Then started Redux, getting to grips with Redux, reducers, constainers and the react-redux library.

**Thoughts:** Will go over the Redux section again tomorrow as lots of new concepts.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 37: Saturday 3 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going over Redux again, and going a bit further. Reducers, containers, actions all a bit complicated. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Wow! Complicated and interesting. Will continue for now and decide whether to switch to the other tutorial and go back to routing for light relief.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 38: Sunday 4 March March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: went over some Redux again, so complicated decided to leave it for now. Went back to ReactRouter and worked through from beginning to params. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Good idea to make progress with something, so moving back to Routing and leaving Redux for now works for me, less likely to get discouraged. Will go back to Redux later.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 39: Monday 5 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed routing, went over the early stages again, then continued to end of section. Really enjoyable. Started on lifecycles, will continue with that topic tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Lots of new things to remember and determined not to be overwhelmed by Redux when I get back to it.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 40: Tuesday 6 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 40 already? Rewound lifecycles and completed this section. Also conditional rendering, returning arrays and PureComponents.

**Thoughts:** As usual will need to go through some of this again, actually most of it!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 41: Wednesday 7 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time attempting a react weather app, code not working, so will leave it for now. Went on to Higher Order Components, will continue with this tomorrow. Intalled a better snippets extension in vscode.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating when stuff just doesn't work and can't work out quite why!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 42: Thursday 8 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through some basic react stuff again, including spread, rest, destructuring and primitive vs reference types. so I really get the hang of it.

**Thoughts:** Understanding more this time around, although still some areas of confusion.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 43: Friday 9 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: None as unwell.

**Thoughts:** Wil add an additional day on to the end!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 44: Saturday 10 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Feeling better, but still a bit wobbly. Managed to spend quite a bit of time going over passing method references and data binding.

**Thoughts:** Will keep repeating sections until I really get it.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 45: Sunday 11 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on an assignment from the tutorial. Doing really well until I got to 2 way binding, then spent ages trying to get it to work.

**Thoughts:** Will go over the 2 way binding again tomorrow, hopefully starting fresh should help.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 46: Monday 12 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going over 2 way binding again.

**Thoughts:** Still confused, but hopefully it will become clearer tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 47: Tuesday 13 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 2 way binding sorted out now, not sure about all the syntax of the methods, but expect practise needed. On to rendering content conditionally, will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Is a steep learning curve, but really interesting.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 48: Wednesday 14 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Conditional rendering started, but getting too confusing, so decided to revise routing and lifecycles.

**Thoughts:** Rather than getting bogged down, best to switch to a different topic for a while. Strategy for not getting discouraged.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 49: Thursday 15 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lifecycles, conditional rendering,PureComponents and returning arrays sections completed. Started higher order components.

**Thoughts:** Streesful as iMac freezing randomly. Will make sure VSCode settings backed up tomorrow if possible.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 50: Friday 16 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: VSCode, all extensions and workplace settings backed up and synced across both desktop and macbook air. Continued with HOCs today, will need some more work tomorrow as seem really complicated.

**Thoughts:** Good feeling having VSCode backed up, particularly as iMac is showing signs of crankiness.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 51: Saturday 17 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Some work on HOCs again, then Redux.

**Thoughts:** Easy to feel overwhelmed by realisation of just how much there is to learn. Don't panic!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day52 : Sunday March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Redux.

**Thoughts:** Getting some of this, but quite confused. Will switch to a different tutorial to see is a different approach helps.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 53: Monday March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revising some basic stuff again.

**Thoughts:** It does help going over stuff again, encouraging to find I understand more than the first time.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 54: Tuesday March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with tutorial, using json server and API calls.

**Thoughts:** Very tired following work today. Difficult to concentrate, will start fresh tomorrow aftenoon.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 55: Wedneday March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Unwell today so no code, will add a second day on to the end.

**Thoughts:** Good to get back to it.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 57: Friday March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got quite lost with the tutorial assignment, so left it for now. Went on to doing proptypes, much better! Then refs, complete with injunction to not actually use them as alter DOM directly, which is undesirable, like mutating state, I guess.

**Thoughts:** Definitely learning to switch topics or tutorials if getting bogged down. Otherwise risk getting discouraged.
