# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on ReactJS Survey App. Problem with tutorial using refs, which are deprecated. Managed to partly fix this with by adding placeholder to the constuctor, then adding this to the input:
``` javascript  
 <input type="text" placeholder={this.state.placeholder} />
```
Will do something else for a while, and then go back to this.
**Thoughts:** 
    Annoying when a tutorial is slightly out of date, but guess it is difficult to keep up with all the rapid changes.

### Day 1: Friday January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting the hang of this.props and pulling in objects from seed file.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating, but also interesting trying to work around a slightly? out of date tutorial, using deprecated refs. Got part way, but left it for now to work through the nice fat 'Fullstack React' book! Doing the voting app.

### Day 2: Saturday January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: continued with book. Getting a bit lost with state and arrays, but will spend more time on this until I get it. Learning a bit more all the time. Found I didn't need to diff files in the (integrated) terminal, but could use 'compare this file with' directly in vscode. 
Now know:
- map creates a new array
- Object.assign to avoid mutating objects
- data flows parent to children through props
- event flows from children to parent through props
- never, never, never mutate state
- have to manually bind custom component methods, as not part of standard React component API
- or can use the 'transform-class-properties' plugin. Can then refactor as arrow functions which will ensure 'this' inside the function is bound to the component 

**Thoughts:** Get a bit lost about where all the methods go, as they are created. Seem to have methods and consts eveywhere. Keep going and go back to earlier stages of tutorials and go through the explanations again.

### Day 10: Sunday February 4, 2018

### Day 19: Tuesday 13 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing Routing project.

**Thoughts:** Driven mad by our slowwwww.... broadband, lucky if we get 0.3Mbps, due to get fibre in the next month or so, can hardly wait. Does make working very difficult. Is a case of npm whatever command, go make another coffee while you wait, and repeat.

### Day 21: Thursday 15 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with yesterdays work, progressing with project. Sense of it coming together. Hope to complete it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Getting quite obsessive. As soon as I arrive home spending as much time as possible on this, just stopping to do essential household stuff.

### Day 22: Friday 16 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Backtracking over earlier stuff to get a better grasp of basics in reactjs.  

**Thoughts:** Getting a bit lost as tutorial progresses. Seems to be a tendency for the tutorials to start off well, going step by step, then suddenly to accelerate and drop loads of new concepts in without much explanation.

### Day 23: Saturday 17 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched to a new tutorial and this one explains every step clearly (so far). Really good stuff on using es6 instead of bind, and using state without a constructor if not explicitly required.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying this today. Hope tutorial continues to be as helpful.

### Day 24: Sunday 18 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting a better grasp of state and props. Also, interested to find conditional css included.

**Thoughts:** Still getting a bit confused by multiple levels on props, but will go over this again.

### Day 25: Monday 19 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through events, state and props again. Getting a better grasp of these. 

**Thoughts:** I will continue with the tutorial and see if this basic stuff starts to consolidate.

### Day 26: Tuesday 20 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Covered different ways of implementing css in React. Objects, glamor and modules. Starting 'filter', can use a function in a child component, from parent via props.

**Thoughts:** Will leave css modules for now as don't want to mess with all the hidden configuration files at this stage. Rather like glamor though.

### Day 27: Wednesday 21 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started routing and linking.
