# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on ReactJS Survey App. Problem with tutorial using refs, which are deprecated. Managed to partly fix this with by adding placeholder to the constuctor, then adding this to the input:
``` javascript
 <input type="text" placeholder={this.state.placeholder} />
```
Will do something else for a while, and then go back to this.
**Thoughts:** 
    Annoying when a tutorial is slightly out of date, but guess it is difficult to keep up with all the rapid changes.

### Day 1: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting the hang of this.props and pulling in objects from seed file.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating, but also interesting trying to work around a slightly? out of date tutorial, using deprecated refs. Got part way, but left it for now to work through the nice fat 'Fullstack React' book! Doing the voting app.
