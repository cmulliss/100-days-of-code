# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Reactjs

### Day 0: Thursday January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on ReactJS Survey App. Problem with tutorial using refs, which are deprecated. Managed to partly fix this with by adding placeholder to the constuctor, then adding this to the input:

```javascript
<input type="text" placeholder={this.state.placeholder} />
```

Will do something else for a while, and then go back to this.
**Thoughts:**
Annoying when a tutorial is slightly out of date, but guess it is difficult to keep up with all the rapid changes.

### Day 1: Friday January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting the hang of this.props and pulling in objects from seed file.

**Thoughts:** Frustrating, but also interesting trying to work around a slightly? out of date tutorial, using deprecated refs. Got part way, but left it for now to work through the nice fat 'Fullstack React' book! Doing the voting app.

---

### Day 2: Saturday January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: continued with book. Getting a bit lost with state and arrays, but will spend more time on this until I get it. Learning a bit more all the time. Found I didn't need to diff files in the (integrated) terminal, but could use 'compare this file with' directly in vscode.
Now know:

* map creates a new array
* Object.assign to avoid mutating objects
* data flows parent to children through props
* event flows from children to parent through props
* never, never, never mutate state
* have to manually bind custom component methods, as not part of standard React component API
* or can use the 'transform-class-properties' plugin. Can then refactor as arrow functions which will ensure 'this' inside the function is bound to the component

**Thoughts:** Get a bit lost about where all the methods go, as they are created. Seem to have methods and consts eveywhere. Keep going and go back to earlier stages of tutorials and go through the explanations again.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 19: Tuesday 13 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing Routing project.

**Thoughts:** Driven mad by our slowwwww.... broadband, lucky if we get 0.3Mbps, due to get fibre in the next month or so, can hardly wait. Does make working very difficult. Is a case of npm whatever command, go make another coffee while you wait, and repeat.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 20: Wednesday 14 February, 2018

---

### Day 21: Thursday 15 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with yesterdays work, progressing with project. Sense of it coming together. Hope to complete it tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 22: Friday 16 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Backtracking over earlier stuff to get a better grasp of basics in reactjs.

**Thoughts:** Getting a bit lost as tutorial progresses. Seems to be a tendency for the tutorials to start off well, going step by step, then suddenly to accelerate and drop loads of new concepts in without much explanation.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 23: Saturday 17 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Switched to a new tutorial and this one explains every step clearly (so far). Really good stuff on using es6 instead of bind, and using state without a constructor if not explicitly required.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 26: Tuesday 20 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Covered different ways of implementing css in React. Objects, glamor and modules. Starting 'filter', can use a function in a child component, from parent via props.

**Thoughts:** Will leave css modules for now as don't want to mess with all the hidden configuration files at this stage. Rather like glamor though.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 27: Wednesday 21 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started routing and linking.

---

### Day 30: Saturday 24 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redoing the youtube search tutorial, not as easy as expected. Can definitely do more of it than last time, but still getting a bit lost with some of it.

**Thoughts:** Some days really happy with progress, other days quite frustrated. Need to keep a positive attitude and not get discouraged on the difficult days!

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 31: Sunday 25 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Redoing some state and props and ES6.

**Thoughts:** Slow progress, but getting there. Will go over 'map' tomorrow.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 32: Monday 26 February, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Map, filter and generally getting a better grounding in state, props, fat arrows and passing functions via props so can limit use of class component and state.

**Thoughts:** Think I am rather impatient, want to understand it all instantly! In fact need to just keep practising.

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

**Thoughts:** Will go over the Redux section again tomorrow as lots of new concepts.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 37: Saturday 3 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going over Redux again, and going a bit further. Reducers, containers, actions all a bit complicated. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Wow! Complicated and interesting. Will continue for now and decide whether to switch to the other tutorial and go back to routing for light relief.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 38: Sunday 4 March March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: went over some Redux again, so complicated decided to leave it for now. Went back to ReactRouter and worked through from beginning to params. Will continue tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Good idea to make progress with something, so moving back to Routing and leaving Redux for now works for me, less likely to get discouraged. Will go back to Redux later.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 39: Monday 5 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed routing, went over the early stages again, then continued to end of section. Really enjoyable. Started on lifecycles, will continue with that topic tomorrow.

---

### Day 40: Tuesday 6 March, 2018

---

### Day 41: Wednesday 7 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time attempting a react weather app, code not working, so will leave it for now. Went on to Higher Order Components, will continue with this tomorrow. Intalled a better snippets extension in vscode.

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 45: Sunday 11 March, 2018

<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>

---

### Day 48: Wednesday 14 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Conditional rendering started, but getting too confusing, so decided to revise routing and lifecycles.

**Thoughts:** Rather than getting bogged down, best to switch to a different topic for a while. Strategy for not getting discouraged.

---

### Day 49: Thursday 15 March, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got quite lost with the tutorial assignment, so left it for now. Went on to doing proptypes, much better! Then refs, complete with injunction to not actually use them as alter DOM directly, which is undesirable, like mutating state, I guess.

**Thoughts:** Definitely learning to switch topics or tutorials if getting bogged down. Otherwise risk getting discouraged.

**Link to work:**
<https://github.com/cmulliss/100-days-of-code>
